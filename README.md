To Grasp

## STEPS:
* setting up environment - all
* point cloud library learning - all
* filtering -
* downsampling -
* stitching the point cloud - do we really need it?  (bonus)
* segementation  -
* get normals -
* spawn objects -
	* sphere on a table
	* cuboid on a table
	* glass vase on a table
* grasp calculation -
	* find optimal grasp
	* moving the camera
	* how do we assign tangential axis once we get the normal vectors
	* probably do it in another node

* move camera optimally (optional)
* move robot to grasp (optional)
